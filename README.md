# Cloud-Computing
By using CloudSim, researchers and industry-based developers can focus on specific system design issues that they want to investigate, without getting concerned about the low level details related to Cloud-based infrastructures and services.

CloudSim Projects helps researchers and industry-based developers to focus on specific system design issues that they want to investigate, without getting concerned about the low level details related to Cloud-based infrastructures and services.

Cloud computing Projects has emerged as the leading technology for delivering reliable, secure, fault-tolerant, sustainable, and scalable computational services, which are presented as Software, Infrastructure, or Platform as services (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS). Moreover, these services may be offered in private data centers (private clouds), may be commercially offered for clients (public clouds), or yet it is possible that both public and private clouds are combined in hybrid clouds.

Overview of CloudSim functionalities:
- support for modeling and simulation of large scale Cloud computing data centers
- support for modeling and simulation of virtualized server hosts, with customizable policies for provisioning host resources to virtual machines
- support for modeling and simulation of application containers
- support for modeling and simulation of energy-aware computational resources
- support for modeling and simulation of data center network topologies and message-passing applications
- support for modeling and simulation of federated clouds
- support for dynamic insertion of simulation elements, stop and resume of simulation
- support for user-defined policies for allocation of hosts to virtual machines and policies for allocation of host resources to virtual machines
